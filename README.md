# Predicting Customer Churn

One of the major issues facing businesses across different sectors is loss of subscribers, a phenomenon better known is customer churn. Being able to identify those customers who are at risk of cancelling their subscriptions would allow businesses to come up with suitable marketing action to keep them onboard, which more often than not cost less than acquiring new customers.

In this project, I will first analyse the customer data from a fictional telecommunications company provided by [IBM](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113) and acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), and then train various classifier models, compare their performance, and select the most suitable one to predict future costumer churn.
